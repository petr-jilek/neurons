# Neurons

Neurons is a python project for machine learning developed from a very basic level, without using any library for machine learning like TensorFlow, etc.

There have been implemented several examples of algorithms like forwardpropagation and backpropagation.

Used python libraries:
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
